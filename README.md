## Introduction
The main goal of this work is to build model in Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS) which is able to predict output based on input data. Dataiku is the platform democratizing access to data and enabling enterprises to build their own path to AI in a human-centric way. The present report results in comparison of two graphs, presenting original data and predicted data.</br>
The work was performed in a free version of the DSS installed under the control of the operating system ubuntu and supporting up to 3 users. The data for analysis was prepared using the Python programming language in Google Colab.
